# Self-fin

A responsive web app to track and manage daily financial activities like expenses, income and investments in a highly secured manner.

## Features

- Sign in using unidirectional bCrypted password which eliminates chances of backtracing original password.
- All data stored in AWS DynamoDb.
- All data are locally encrypted before sendng to cloud (DDB) using combination keys and salts to reduce the possiblity of exposing data from cloud if by chance hacked by hacker.
- User can create following financial activities records: Expense, Income, Investments, Loans, etc.
- User can view all past data per category in an interactive manner using either table or graph to visualize their activities.
- Use of graphical representation of financial activities gives user insight on how they are handling their daily financial activities.
- User can also generate single report for their choices of categories for certain period of time and evalutes the trend in their financial activities like how much they spent and how much was the income at that period of time.
- Now user can use the python script to parse their credit/debit cards statement which can be easily uploaded to the cloud after encryption. This will save time to upload indivial expense one by one.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
